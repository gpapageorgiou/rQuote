<span style = "font-family: 'Orbitron', sans-serif; font-weight: bold">rQuote</span> is an R-package that I developed while trying to teach myself how to develop R-packages. Doing so allowed me to practice the extensive online book on [R-package development](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) and to learn how to create a website for my package using [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). On the same time I was able to learn some web-scraping with [rvest](https://github.com/tidyverse/rvest) and improve my <b>regex</b> skills. It also made this whole process fun and creative. Most importantly, though, I got to read many random quotes!
